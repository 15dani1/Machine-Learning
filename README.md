# Machine and Deep Learning Projects

Here is a collection of Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects that I am currently working on. Starting with some tutorials and getting into more challenging projects with more time and experience. The projects are mainly done using Jupyter Notebook and Python using Tensorflow, Keras, and other python libraries such as MatPlotLib, Numpy, etc.
